Here are some references I use to support my negative view of Phishing Simulation [1]:


_Perspectives:_  

* Sean Cassidy: [Phishing simulations considered harmful](https://www.seancassidy.me/phishing-simulations-considered-harmful.html)
* Jamie Finnigan: [Simulated phishing is not so great](https://chair6.net/simulated-phishing-is-not-so-great.html)
* Yahoo Paranoids: [Stop Giving Impossible Advice: Telling People to Watch Out for SUSPICIOUS EMAILS is Nonsense.](https://www.yahooinc.com/paranoids/stop-giving-impossible-advice-telling-people-to-watch-out-for-suspicious-emails-is-nonsense)

_Research:_   

* [Phishing in Organizations: Findings from a Large-Scale and Long-Term Study](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.07498.pdf)
