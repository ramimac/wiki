It was that time of year again ... Vendors, Analysts, "thought leaders" and security leaders shared their predictions for 2023. 

Here's an overview of those I read and _got something_ from:

## Synthesis

Lots of predictors are "talking their book," with predections aligned to their roles, companies, or investments. This is unsurprising, as the same beliefs likely influence those relationships.

Overall, some themes were:

**The Market**

Consensus seems to be that VCs will invest in early-stage companies, while later-stage companies will see layoffs, down rounds, and PE activity. Cyber Security services may see increased demand. 

**The Threats**

Attackers will evolve:
* adopting new technologies like AI and ML
* introducing cloud-native ransomware and improved exportion capabilities
* leveraging new monetization vectors

Critical Infrastructure will see a continuation in the elevated volume of threat activity.

**Security Programs**

Limitations in budgets and hiring will have security leaders looking to consolidated vendors, but they may still pick tools to balance reducing headcount. Diversity, inclusivity, and cross-training will be used to help with the "talent gap." The supply chain security trend will continue, introducing a push to solutions that avoid profligation of third parties. Privacy and resiliency will be major themes.
