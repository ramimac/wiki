* _Prescriptive_ [The SOC2 Starting Seven](https://latacora.micro.blog/2020/03/12/the-soc-starting.html), [Latacora](https://www.latacora.com/): Latacora is a consultancy that helps build security programs for startups. While this post is stuctured around SOC2, it contains a set of tactical controls that you should implement early and will provide a solid foundation for your security program.
* _Prescriptive_ [Early Security for Startups](https://devd.me/log/posts/startup-security/), [Dev](https://devd.me/): Dev has been down this road, and helped scale security for hypergrowth companies. He goes so far as to call out specific tools and vendors - something we often elide but can be high-leverage if you trust his judgement. You should.
